# Data Structures and Algorithms in JS

The goal here is to provide a comprehensive test suite for each topic with empty implementations, so you can practice implementing these as a refresher, learning for the first time, warming up your chops at the start of the day, or whatever.

This `master` branch has all of the solutions populated and all of the tests passing. If you're looking for the branch where you can find the solutions emptied out and tests failing, the [no-solutions branch](https://github.com/gargrave/data-structures-and-algorithms-js/tree/no-solutions) is what you want.

A lot of this material is based off of and/or expanded from the following repos:

- [Exercises for Intro to Algorithms and Data Structures in JavaScript](https://github.com/kuychaco/algoClass)
- [4 Semesters of CS, Part 2](https://github.com/btholt/four-semesters-of-cs-part-two)

(If the project structure seems... elaborate... for such a simple project, it is because I went the lazy way and used `create-react-app` to bootstrap the linting, testing, and such. Obviously there is no actual React in use here--the only command you really need to use is `yarn test` to run the tests. )
