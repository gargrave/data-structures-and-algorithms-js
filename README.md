# Data Structures and Algorithms in JS

The goal here is to provide a comprehensive test suite for each topic with empty implementations, so you can practice implementing these as a refresher, learning for the first time, warming up your chops at the start of the day, or whatever.

I still need to add the branch with the actual implementations removed, so this is still a work-in-progress.

A lot of this material is based off of and/or expanded from the following repos:

- [Exercises for Intro to Algorithms and Data Structures in JavaScript](https://github.com/kuychaco/algoClass)
- [4 Semesters of CS, Part 2](https://github.com/btholt/four-semesters-of-cs-part-two)

(If the project structure seems... elaborate... for such a simple project, it is because I went the lazy way and used `create-react-app` to bootstrap the linting, testing, and such. Obviously there is no actual React in use here--the only command you really need to use is `yarn test` to run the tests. )
